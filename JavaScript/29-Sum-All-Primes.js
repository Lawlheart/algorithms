// Sum all the prime numbers up to and including the provided number.
// A prime number is defined as having only two divisors, 1 and itself. For example, 2 is a prime number because it's only divisible by 1 and 2. 1 isn't a prime number, because it's only divisible by itself.
// The provided number may not be a prime.

function sumPrimes(num) {
  return num;
}

sumPrimes(10);

// TESTING
// sumPrimes(10) should return a number.
// sumPrimes(10) should return 17.
// sumPrimes(977) should return 73156.
