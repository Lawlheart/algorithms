# NO REPEATS PLEASE
# Return the number of total permutations of the provided string that don't have repeated consecutive letters.
# For example, 'aab' should return 2 because it has 6 total permutations, but only 2 of them don't have the same letter (in this case 'a') repeating.



# TESTING
# permAlone("aab") should return a number.
# permAlone("aab") should return 2.
# permAlone("aaa") should return 0.
# permAlone("aabb") should return 8.
# permAlone("abcdefa") should return 3600.
# permAlone("abfdefa") should return 2640.
# permAlone("zzzzzzzz") should return 0.
